In this repo, we have some objects:
* make some example about signal reconstruction based FRI sampling method.
  * Streams of Dirac signal
  * Non-uniform splines
  * piecewise polynomials
  * UWB signal - Streams of Gaussian pulse ‚≠ê
* build a general module for FRI sampling method.
* Try AI method to identify the finite rate innovation.
